# vision-motion-control
Computer Vision–Based Control System 🤖👋

Overview

This project aims to build a simple and practical system that controls a physical device using hand gestures detected by a camera.

The main idea is to combine:
	•	Computer Vision for hand gesture detection
	•	Software running on a laptop
	•	Hardware that reacts to commands (e.g. turning a light ON/OFF)

This is an educational and experimental project, designed to simulate a real R&D teamwork environment rather than a traditional course.

⸻

Project Goals
	•	Learn how to detect hand movements using a camera
	•	Convert gestures into logical commands
	•	Send commands from software to hardware
	•	Control a real-world device
	•	Practice teamwork, documentation, and system thinking

⸻

Project Structure

The project is divided into two main teams:

🧠 Software Team

Responsibilities:
	•	Research hand detection and gesture recognition methods
	•	Evaluate suitable libraries (e.g. OpenCV, MediaPipe)
	•	Define how gestures are translated into commands
	•	Specify communication requirements with hardware

🔧 Hardware Team

Responsibilities:
	•	Propose a simple hardware setup (e.g. light control)
	•	Select a suitable microcontroller
	•	Design communication with the laptop
	•	Define hardware requirements from the software side

⸻

Technologies (Initial)
	•	Python
	•	OpenCV / MediaPipe (to be evaluated)
	•	Microcontrollers (Arduino / ESP / similar)
	•	Serial or wireless communication
